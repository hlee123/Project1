      <strong>(This video was taken during boat tour...)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>I bought ticket for boat tour for $37, and the ticket box is located Michigan Ave, under DuSable Bridge. My ticket is Lake & River Architecture Tour to see Many Architecture at sunset and night.</p>
    <p>Tickets prices are a little expensive but I strongly recommend them. Because through this tour, you can see a view of downtown chicago.</p>

    <p>After the boat tour, I went to Navy Pier. I saw nice fireworks there. It was a great day.</p>
